Set Up Routing with react-router:
Added main routes such as: /, /about, /login, /register, /profile, /wishlist, /recommended.
Fixed dynamic route conflicts by organizing:
/meals/:category â†’ for the MealsPage.
/meal/:name â†’ for the MealDetails.
Created Pages:
âœ… About âœ… MealDetails âœ… MealsPage âœ… Recommended
Created Reusable Components:
âœ… CategoryCardâœ… MealCardâœ… HeroSecâœ… Contact)
âœ… Slider

    Today I worked on the Hero Section in our React project.

Implemented a Swiper Slider for the hero background.

Added a background image with a gradient overlay to make the content more readable.

Made the section fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Added a header title, a text search bar, and two action buttons for better user interaction.

The Hero Section is now fully functional and ready for integration. ðŸš€
